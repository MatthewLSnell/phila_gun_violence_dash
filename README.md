# Plotly Dash Shootings Data Visualization Application

This application is an interactive tool developed using Plotly Dash to visualize gun violence trends and patterns in Philadelphia from 2015 through Present.  By transforming raw data into insightful visualizations, the application seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of gun violence trends and patterns in Philadelphia. 

## Analysis
This Dash application provides a comprehensive visualization and analysis of gun violence incidents in Philadelphia, highlighting trends and patterns in various views.

The interactive features of the app allow users to explore different aspects of the shootings data, including:

- **Shootings Per Year:** This bar chart displays the total number of shootings for each year, segmented by the victim outcome (either fatal or non-fatal). It offers insights into the annual trend of shooting incidents.

- **Shootings Per Month:** This bar chart provides a monthly breakdown of shooting incidents. Users can examine the distribution of shootings throughout the year and identify any seasonal trends.

The application also includes a dropdown feature, enabling users to filter the data by specific years and police districts. This feature allows for more targeted analysis, helping users to examine trends and patterns within specific time periods or geographical areas.
